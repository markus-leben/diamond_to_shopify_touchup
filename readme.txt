Instructions on use:
0.) install python if your computer doesn't already have python on it.
1.) drag one or more .csv files, or a folder of .csv files from diamond's shopify exporter and drop them in the folder
this program is in.
2.) double click on touchup.py
3.) you should see a file named touched_up_and_combined.csv

Honestly it should be just that plug and play. That should touch up the titles, the publishers, and add the publisher
names to tags. I'd do more with author names, but it'd be kinda a pain in the butt because diamond doesn't export those.
So I'd have to go searching elsewhere for them. Let me know if anything doesn't work well
